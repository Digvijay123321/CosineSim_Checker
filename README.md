# CosineSim_Checker
CosinSim_Checker is a document comparison and validation tool that evaluates the similarity between a model-generated document and an official 10-K form using cosine similarity. It utilizes embeddings from five different models—OpenAI, T5-small, BERT, RoBERTa, and Modern BERT—to compute similarity scores.
